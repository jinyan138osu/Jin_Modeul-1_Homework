Per the graph from "Outcomes based on Goals", we discover that the higher the fundraising goals were set up, the harder they were able to achieve. For fundraising goals less than $1000, 71% of the kickstarter campaigns were able to successfully achieve their fundraising goals. However, for those goals more than $50,000, only 19% of the kickstarter campaigns achieved their fundraising goals and 58% and 23% of the kickstarter campaigns were failed and canceled respectively.

Per the graph from "Outcomes Based on Launch Date", we discvoer that for kickstart campaigns in the theatre category, the successful rate is higher in months from April to September compared to the rest of the year. As such, going forward if theatre related kickstarter campaigns are going to be launched in the future, they should be launched between April and September.
